            <p>My name is Tyson Richins! I am from Queen Creek Arizona. I am a freshman and studying Design and Development.</p>
            <p>I love to do anything outdoors, fishing, hunting, camping, football and volleyball.</p>
            <p>I see many advantages from studying and taking this class. Everything is turning online and it is useful to understand computers and everything that is around us.</p>
            <p>I have been a member all of my life. One of my favorite scriptures is Mosiah 7:33 where it states that as we follow Jesus Christ we will be freed from bondage!</p>
